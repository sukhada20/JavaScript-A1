## 🧩 Practical 1 – Student Information Portal (SIT Nagpur)

### 🎯 **Aim**

To design a dynamic web page using **HTML**, **CSS (Tailwind)**, and **JavaScript** that displays student details and provides interactive features such as popups, modals, and smooth scrolling.

---

### 🧠 **Objective**

* To understand the integration of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for dynamic web design.
* To implement **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** in JavaScript.
* To enhance user interaction using **popups, modals, and smooth scrolling**.
* To use **Tailwind CSS** for creating a responsive and modern interface.

---

### 🧾 **Theory**

JavaScript enables client-side interactivity by manipulating HTML elements and responding to user actions such as clicks or page load events.
In this project, JavaScript is used to:

* Show welcome alerts or popups.
* Display and hide student information dynamically.
* Prevent background scrolling when modals are open.
* Smoothly scroll between webpage sections.

Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for fast, responsive styling without writing custom CSS.

### ⚙️ **Algorithm / Steps**

1. **Create the HTML structure** for the webpage:

   * Header and navigation bar.
   * Hero section or welcome popup.
   * Student information table.
   * About, Contact, and Footer sections.

2. **Add Tailwind CSS** via CDN for styling and layout.

3. **Implement JavaScript functions:**

   * `showWelcomeAlert()` – Displays a welcome message.
   * `showStudentInfo()` – Opens the student information modal.
   * `hideStudentInfo()` – Closes the modal and restores page scroll.
   * `window.onload` – Triggers a welcome alert on page load.

4. **Enhance interactivity**:

   * Use event listeners for buttons and navigation links.
   * Add smooth scrolling for anchor links.

5. **Test responsiveness** and user interactions.

  * A **welcome popup/alert**.
  * A **styled table** containing student records (Name, Roll No, Department, Year, Resume link).
  * **Modal window** for detailed student info and academic overview.
  * **Smooth navigation** and interactive buttons.
